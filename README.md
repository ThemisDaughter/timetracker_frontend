# Timetracker

As someone with fast-changing interests, I needed a way to keep track of my learning process. Normal todo apps woudn't do. I needed something to track the time spent on a subject, if possible even the regularity with which I learn (coming soon?). So this is the skeleton I came up with:

# Getting Started 
What you need: a text editor, Node Package Manager and git bash. Since the backend uses sqlite, no database is required.

go to the [backend repository](https://github.com/ThemisDaughter/timetracker_backend) and click on the green 'code' button at the top right corner of the file overview.

Then, in your terminal, cd into the folder you want to save the repository and type git clone [insert url here]. Once the loading is done, type cd timetracker_backend and press enter. Then, enter the command npm i to install all the dependencies needed to get the server up and running. Finally, type 'nodemon' and press enter again and voil√†, your server is running! (you won't see anything on the screen yet, that's normal)
Now repeat the process with this repository with one small difference. Instead of 'nodemon', use the command npm start to start the program. And now you should finally see something!
